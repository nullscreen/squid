Squid
=====

Squid helps you write Ruby code to draw graphs in PDF files.

The **source code** is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Fullscreen/squid) and the **documentation** on [RubyDoc](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/Fullscreen/squid/master/Squid/Interface).

[Prawn](http://prawnpdf.org) is a great Ruby library to generate PDF files
but lacks high-level components to draw graphs.

Squid adds a single method `chart(data = {}, options = {})` to Prawn.

Provide the `data` to plot as a hash, with each key/value representing a series.

For instance, the following code generates the graph below:

```ruby
data = {views: {2013 => 182, 2014 => 46, 2015 => 134}}
chart data
```
